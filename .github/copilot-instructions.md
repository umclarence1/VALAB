## Project Overview
This is a Virtual Chemistry Lab application built for DI-Hack 2025 under the theme "Co-Designing Accessibility: Empowering Persons with Disabilities Through Technology". The app focuses on creating an accessible virtual laboratory experience for physically challenged students.

## Tech Stack
- **React 19** - Main frontend framework
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics and scenes
- **React Three Fiber** - React renderer for Three.js
- **React Three Drei** - Helper components for R3F
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and transitions
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server

## Key Features
- Interactive 3D lobby with multiple lab doors
- Virtual chemistry laboratory with realistic equipment
- Accessibility features (voice commands, screen reader support, keyboard navigation)
- Smooth animations and transitions between scenes
- Responsive design for multiple devices

## Coding Guidelines
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Implement proper accessibility (ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation)
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use TypeScript-style prop validation where possible
- Follow React Three Fiber best practices for 3D scenes
- Ensure animations are smooth and performant
- Add proper error boundaries and loading states

## Accessibility Requirements
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Provide alternative text for visual elements
- Support screen readers with proper ARIA labels
- Include high contrast mode support
- Voice command integration for hands-free operation
- Ensure proper focus management in 3D scenes
